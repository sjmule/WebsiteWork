VALUES ('openWings','How do butterflies/moths spread their wings after emerging?','<p>The process of a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis is called eclosion.&nbsp; Eclosion is controlled by hormones.&nbsp; These hormones are released to soften the chrysalis and to trigger the central nervous system begin the movements needed to complete the emergence process.&nbsp; If you look closely at a chrysalis you can see where the eyes and legs are beneath the hard surface.&nbsp; After the chrysalis has been softened and often become transparent the butterfly will push through first with its legs also removing the triangular piece covering its eyes and proboscis.&nbsp; The butterfly then crawls the rest of the way out of the chrysalis, exposing the abdomen and wings.&nbsp; The butterfly hangs upside down from the chrysalis or a nearby surface to complete the emergence process.&nbsp; The wings appear folded or crinkled and the butterfly must begin the process of expanding and drying its wings before flight is possible.&nbsp; Meconium is pumped into the venation structures of the wings by wing movement and the help of gravity.&nbsp; Once the wings have fully expanded, the meconium will be pumped back into the body of the butterfly.&nbsp; The small amounts still in the veins of the wings will dry and harden giving the wings a more sturdy structure that will allow flight.&nbsp; It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours for a butterflyâ€™s wings to completely dry, this is usually varied according to size.&nbsp; After the wings have dried but before the butterfly will take its first flight it will dispel the excess meconium from its body.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql92zFDqoMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>');
